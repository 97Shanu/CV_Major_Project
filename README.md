# Table-scan :Noble tool to detect and extract tables from images.

The computer vision community has witnessed the significant success of table detection techniques over the last decade. However, converting the detected tables into digital format is still a challenge. So in this repo, Ashish Aman (M22MA002) and Bhawna Bhoria (M22MA003) have studied the techniques of performing table detection with the help of deep learning concepts. This purpose is implemented using both inbuilt functions and defining models from scratch. Further, comparisons are done in between various techniques. Hence, this idea will have great practical applications in the documentation domain where the artifacts and physical documentation can be transformed into digital format.
Table detection from an image can be achieved using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques combined with image processing techniques. Here is an overview of the steps involved in detecting tables from an image:
Preprocessing the image, detecting contours like horizontal and vertical lines, identifying table regions, extracting text with optical character recognition, and finally post-processing the results to format the data into a table are all necessary phases in the process of table detection from an image. Python offers a number of libraries and tools, including OpenCV, Scikit-Image, and EasyOCR, that can be used to detect tables in images. The level of precision and performance required, as well as the image's complexity and quality, will determine the method and approaches employed. Data input, invoice processing, and document scanning are just a few of the many uses for automated table detection from photos.Next we have trained our custom dataset on different versions of YOLO V5 and V8 to detect the table and done their comparisons. After that our first method is implemented to extract data from the table detected in it. Time is saved and accuracy is increased in data extraction and analysis when images of tables are processed in this way.

    For Table extractions:
    Open the Table_Detection.ipynb file in google colab
    install the requirements mentioned in the code
    Upload the sample image or input image attached in the input.
    give the no. of columns as in the figure in the output.
    Run the cell one by one.
    Required datframe and the evaluation metrics of jaccard similarity will be obtained of your desired image.
